Amazon is an American technology multinational specializing in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence. Founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, Amazon is one of the largest online retailers in the world, offering a range of products ranging from books and music to furniture and clothing. It also offers services like Amazon Prime, which offers unlimited streaming access to movies and TV shows, as well as free two-day shipping on millions of items.

### [What is Amazon](https://www.arimetrics.com/en/digital-glossary/amazon)

I aimed to generate insights about Amazon sales, including:

- The difference between **order date** and **ship date**
- Year-over-Year **(YoY)** and Month-over-Month **(MoM)** comparisons
- Analysis of **item types**, **order priority**, and **regional sales**

I obtained the database from the **Kaggle website** at:

### [Amazon Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mithilesh9/amazon-sales-data-analysis)

During this project, I focused on improving my skills in **Power BI** by implementing the following functionalities:

- **Time Intelligence** for advanced date-based analysis
- **Visually** appealing **cards** to highlight key metrics
- A **dashboard** template designed using **Figma**
- **Variance graphs** to show differences and trends
- **Metrics** neatly **organized** into folders for better structure

# Important

The database does not contain information about **CLOUD COMPUTING** or **AWS SERVICES**, which represent a significant portion of Amazon's profits.

Additionally, some regions lack data for major countries. For example, the **North America** region only includes data for **Mexico**.

Therefore, this dataset does not provide a complete view of Amazon's global sales data from **2010** to **2017**.

# Results

Differents insights can be retrived from the dashboard, however, i will quote some results obtained from the analysis.

1. This analysis highlights the **Sub-Saharan Africa region** as the top performer in sales volume, with a strong **preference for suits**, irrespective of the sales channel (online or offline).

2. The significant delay between **order and ship dates** in **November** and **January** suggests increased sales activity, possibly linked to seasonal demand such as **holidays** and **promotions**.
   
3. This analysis reveals that **cosmetics** and **clothes dominate sales**, whereas meat and snacks contribute the least to overall sales, indicating a disparity in consumer demand across product categories.
